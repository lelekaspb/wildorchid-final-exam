  "about.julia.body": "“I am very open to my customers. I tell about my life and they tell me about theirs. My treatments are good and satisfying and I am very thorough. I may decide to take the rest of the hair to be removed with tweezers if I am not satisfied. That is why several of my clients call me a perfectionist, ”says Julia Kurkova, who comes from Russia.",
  "about.salon.body": "At Wild Orchid, you are sure to get a good and thorough treatment no matter which one you choose.

To achieve this, we use disposable tools and sterilize disposable equipment properly. We also pay special attention to our recyclable equipment. All instruments we use undergo a 4-step cleaning process. The tools are treated with disinfectant spray; second, then washed to ensure that no skin particles remain after a procedure; the instruments are subjected to hot air sterilization; and finally the tools are placed in a UV sterilizer where they are stored until the next procedure."
